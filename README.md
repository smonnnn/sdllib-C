# sdllib C
Simple library for deep learning inference and training, written in C.
Uses my own matrix library.

To compile the library, simply run the bash script "compile.sh".
There's an example bash script called "run.sh" that compiles the dependencies and a test file to an executable binary.

### TODO
Figure out how to not rotate buffer_1.

Save and load a network from disk.
